            <p>
            Free Feather is a center of inspiration located in Athens, running three gatherings every week; Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The gatherings are divided in four sessions; discussion, workshop, mission and jam session. Discussions can be about Permaculture, Communication or Travel, and workshops can be about Art, Technology or Health. More information about the subjects, follow the link here. The mission focuses on the making of arts and crafts to sustain and develop our non-profit organisation. Finalizing the gathering, we jam with music, dancing, juggling, or any other art by synchronising our rhythms and communicating our improvisations. We also serve healthy Food and Drinks. Everything is free and entrance is by invitation only.
