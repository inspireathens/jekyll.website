<h4>Host</h4>
<p>Events are not organized by me but Cafe, Bars or other places. I took the initiative to promote their events. This is a great opportunity for more people to get involved in collaborative activities in spaces that do not require invitation and are public.</p>
<p>In gatherings I work together with the participants to schedule the next week's schedule. My job is to setup and prepare the space so that participants who have decided to host a discussion, workshop, mission or jam session will be able to.</p>
<h4>Entrance</h4>
<p>The Events I list here are entrance free and open to the public. I do not include events with entrance costs or any other entrance requirements. This is good to have an option for joining collaborative activities, more open to the public.</p>
<p>The gatherings on the other hand are by invitation only because of the family environment. We know and trust each other for the space and equipment used. Food and Drinks can be provided to everyone this way too.</p>
<h4>Activities</h4>
<p>Events are usually scheduled for a specific purpose. Gatherings do not have this limitation because they are designed with four stages (Discussions, Workshops, Missions, Jam Sessions) that are hosted by any of the participants who show interest in sharing some knowledge and skills.</p>
<h4>Food and Drinks</h4>
<p>In Cafe, Bars, Restaurants or other Venues you may get a free drink, and food is a rare case. The menu can be the same every time you visit and the variety may also be limited. That is why free Food and Drinks are important in the gatherings. You also have the option on bringing ingredients, prepared food or drinks. That way we can enjoy more for the next gatherings too.</p>
