Since 2011 I've been working on a way to invite people in a space where we can be comfortable and creative. I believe this can  become an exciting experience for all of us, getting together and collaborate freely. What I wish to do is inspire and get inspired. Let me tell you how it all started.

In late 2011, I left Greece for England. I was about to continue my travels in Europe again. In England, I was living in a basement (Kent, Gillingham) where I refurbished it, built furniture for it and gathered all the resources I needed to get something started. I organized once a week, gatherings with food and drinks that I prepared with some friends for everyone that was invited. It was very nice to see that other people brought with them some more food, drinks, gifts, etc. The purpose for each gathering was to run discussions and workshops that anyone would love to host. Every gathering was accompanied by music, juggling and other performed arts. This also took place in a second basement (Kent, Chatham) where a friend of mine, Luka Lukasik was also organizing gatherings. We carried on with this project together in a land near Canterbury where we organized larger gatherings with more discussions, workshops, performances, jam sessions and other creative activities. We took it further in Europe. Started our travels meeting other communities, busking in many cities, towns and villages. Our first big stop was in Bydgoszcz, Poland. We started with our first very own land, cultivating, building and of course organizing more gatherings. In Poland, I had the opportunity to help setting up Boski festival and run a Jam Session stage in a Teepee. Freely perform in our favorite local pub, Letniak. Last but not least, meet more amazing artists, scientists, philosophers, etc.

Continuing our journey through more countries, visiting more places, we ended up at our second big stop, Greece. So here I am now, back to the country I grew up in. For five months since my arrival, I and other friends found a great spot at a top of hill in Attiki, Loutsa. With panoramic view of the sea on one side and the Athens International Airport on the other. We had many visitors coming from many countries with many stories, ideas, opinions, knowledge and creations to share. The strongest and most real examples for what I am aiming for, happened there. Those five months was a big challenge and a big step to learn many things when it comes to a space that we all live in together. We had though to leave that place behind where many dreams came true. Every single effort there was to create and share something beautiful that was done by everyone and I thank you all.

So now I want to bring these activities even closer to Athens, closer to more people that can get inspired so I can get inspired too.
